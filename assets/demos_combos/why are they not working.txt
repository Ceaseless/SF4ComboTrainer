if the combo trainer seems to run okay and you don't have frame drops or laggin but these combos still don't work 
- maybe the combo needs meter and you have none
- maybe the combo doesn't work in the corner
- maybe the combo only works in the corner
- maybe you are to far away from the opponent
- maybe you selected the wrong ultra
- maybe the guy who wrote the combo is an idiot
